\chapter{Approach}\label{chap:approach}

To achieve this our approach would be:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item On-prem database, and use cloud solution for compute and storage. For compute we will use lambda and storage - S3
 \item Reporting solution on a different cloud. We will create a report to access data from on-prem database and S3 from a reporting tool like PowerBi or Sisense on a different cloud
 \item Create S3 bucket
 \item Create a table in Dynamo DB
 \item Create EC2 instance or Machine Learning to analyze a csv file and predict based on this analysis
 \item Lastly if time permits upload data from S3 to Dynamo DB
 \end{enumerate} 

\section{Problem Definition}

How to utilize cloud for computing when the unit of work is for a few hours instead of spending money and resources on managing on-premise resources.
