\chapter{Approach}\label{chap:approach}

To achieve this our approach would be:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Create S3 bucket
 \item Create a table in Dynamo DB
 \item Create EC2 instance or Machine Learning to analyze a csv file and predict based on this analysis
 \item Lastly if time permits upload data from S3 to Dynamo DB
 \end{enumerate} 

\section{Problem Definition}
